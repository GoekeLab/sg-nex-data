The Singapore Nanopore Expression (SG-NEx) project is an international collaboration to generate reference transcriptomes and a comprehensive benchmark data set for long read Nanopore RNA-Seq. Transcriptome profiling is done using PCR-cDNA sequencing ("PCR-cDNA"), amplification-free cDNA sequencing ("direct cDNA"), direct sequencing of native RNA (“direct RNA”), and short read RNA-Seq. The SG-NEx core data includes 5 of the most commonly used cell lines and it is extended with additional cell lines and samples that cover a broad range of human tissues. All core samples are sequenced with at least 3 high quality replicates. For a subset of samples spike-in RNAs are used and matched m6A profiling data is available.

The SG-NEx data set is documented here: https://github.com/GoekeLab/sg-nex-data
