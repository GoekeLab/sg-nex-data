# SG-NEx - The Singapore Nanopore-Expression Project
## The Singapore Nanopore-Expression Project

The SG-NEx project was initiated by the Genome Institute of Singapore with the aim to generate reference transcriptomes for 5 of the most commonly used cancer cell lines using Nanopore RNA-Seq data. The following cell lines are used for sequencing:

* A549 (Lung Cancer)    
* MCF7 (Breast Cancer)   
* Hct116 (Colon Cancer)
* K562 (Leukemia)  
* HepG2 (Liver Cancer)     
   

Transcriptome profiling is done using PCR-cDNA sequencing ("PCR-cDNA"), amplification-free cDNA sequencing ("direct cDNA"), and direct sequencing of native RNA (“direct RNA”). 

## Data download
Data can be downloaded [here](DATA.md)     
Notes on data usage: This site provides early access to the SG-NEx data for research. Please note that the data is under publication embargo until the SG-NEx project is published.

## Data Processing

We collaborated with [nf-core group](https://github.com/nf-core) to develop [nanoseq](https://github.com/nf-core/nanoseq), a standardardized pipeline for Nanopore RNA data processing.
