# SG-NEx - The Singapore Nanopore-Expression Project

The SG-NEx project is an international collaboration that was initiated at the [Genome Institute of Singapore](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/gis/). The aim of the SG-NEx Project is to generate reference transcriptomes for 5 of the most commonly used cancer cell lines using Nanopore long read RNA-Seq data:

Transcriptome profiling is done using PCR-cDNA sequencing ("PCR-cDNA"), amplification-free cDNA sequencing ("direct cDNA"), direct sequencing of native RNA (“direct RNA”), and short read RNA-Seq. All samples are sequenced with at least 3 high quality replicates. For a subset of samples, we used sequin spike-in RNAs.

## Data Releases

**Pre-Release (v0.1)**

Data can be downloaded [here](DATA.md)     
Notes on data usage: This site provides early access to the SG-NEx data for research. Please note that the data is under publication embargo until the SG-NEx project is published.

## Data Processing

We collaborated with [nf-core](https://github.com/nf-core) to develop [nanoseq](https://github.com/nf-core/nanoseq), a standardardized pipeline for Nanopore RNA-Seq data processing.
