### Datasets

  As the core datasets, we have in total 72 different protocol runs for core cell lines. As an initial release, we are providing fastq and bam files at the moment. Please refer to [this file]() for the sample information as well as the downloading links of all the data.

  Notes on data usage: This site provides early access to the SG-NEx data for research. Please note that the data is under publication embargo until the SG-NEx project is published.
