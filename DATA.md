### Datasets

  As the core datasets, we have in total 72 runs for core cell lines using three different Nanopore RNA-Sequencing prototocols. 
  
  As an initial release, we are providing fastq and bam files at the moment. Please refer to [this file](docs/Sample_information.txt) for the sample information as well as the downloading links of all the data.

  Notes on data usage: This site provides early access to the SG-NEx data for research. Please note that the data is under publication embargo until the SG-NEx project is published.
